Assignments on Java Class

1) Create a class “Room” which will hold the “height”, “width” and “breadth” of the room in three fields. This class also has a method “volume()” to calculate the volume of this room. Create another class “RoomDemo” which will use the earlier class, create instances of rooms, and display the volume of room. 

2) Write a program to implement a class “student” with the following members.
Name of the student.
Marks of the student obtained in three subjects.
Function to assign initial values.
Function to compute total average.
Function to display the student’s name and the total marks.
Write an appropriate main() function to demonstrate the functioning of the above.

3) Write a class “Box” that with three member-variables “height”, “width” and “breadth”. Write suitable constructors to initialize them. Add functions like “getVolume” and “getArea” that will return volume and surface area respectively. Instantiate two arbitrary boxes and then print their volume and surface area.

4) Implement a class for stack of integers using an array. Please note that the operations defined for a stack data structure are as follows: “push”, “pop”, “print”. 
There should be a constructor to create an array of integers; the size of the array is provided by the user.
Write a main() function to (i) create a stack to hold maximum of 30 integers; (ii) push the numbers 10, 20, 30, 15, 9 to the stack; (iii) print the stack; (iii) pop thrice and (iv) print the stack again.

5) Write a class “BankAccount” with the following instance variables:
AccountNumber (an integer), balance a floating-point number), and “ownerName” (a String). Write proper constructor for this class. Also write methods balance, add (to deposit an amount), and subtract (to withdraw an amount) and implement them. Now create another class “AccountManager” that contains an array of BankAccount. Write methods create (to create an account), delete(to terminate an account), deposit (to deposit an amount to an account) and withdraw (to withdraw an amount from an account). Also write a class “Bank”, add main() function that creates an AccountManager and add 5 accounts. Now print the details of all accounts in this Bank.

6) Write a class to represent complex numbers with necessary constructors. Write member functions to add, multiply two complex numbers. 
There should be three constructors: (i) to initialize real and imaginary parts to 0; (ii) to initialize imaginary part to 0 but to initialize the real part to user defined value; (iii) to initialize the real part and the imaginary part to user defined values.
Also, write a main() function to (i) create two complex numbers 3+2i and 4-2i; (ii) to print the sum and product of those numbers.

7) Implement a class for “Date”. Write member functions for (i) getting the previous day, (iv) getting the next day, (iii) printing a day
There should be four constructors: (i) day, month and year are initialized to 01, 01, 1970; (ii) day is initialized to user specified value but month and year are initialized to 01, 1970; (iii) day, month are initialized to user specified value but year is initialized to 1970; (iv) day, month and year are initialized to user defined values.
Also, write a main() function to (i) create a date object; (ii) print the next and the previous day.
 
8) Implement a class for a “Book”. Book contains a title (a String), a list of authors (array of authors), number of pages (an integer), price (floating point number), publisher (a String) etc. Write suitable constructor and accessor/modifier methods.
Implement a class for “Library”. A library contains a list of books (array of Book). Write add (to add a book) and remove (to delete a book) methods for library. 
Write a main() function to create a “Library” and add five “Book” to library. Print the total price of all books.
 
9) Write a Java class “Employee” containing information name, id, address, salary etc. Write necessary constructor and read/write methods.
Create a class “Dept” that has a name, location etc. The “Dept” contains a number of “Employee”. Write methods “add” and “remove” to add and remove an employee to/from this department.
Write a main() function and create “Information Technology” department. Add five employees and print yearly expenditure for this department.

10) Implement a class for a “Student”. Information about a student includes name, roll no and an array of five subject names. The class should have suitable constructor and get/set methods.
Implement a class “TabulationSheet”. A tabulation sheet contains roll numbers and marks of each student for a particular subject. This class should have a method for adding the marks and roll no of a student.
Implement a class “MarkSheet”. A mark sheet contains marks of all subjects for a particular student. This class should have a method to add name of a student and marks in each subject.
Write a main() function to create three “Student” objects, Five “Tabulationsheet” objects for Five subjects and three “Marksheet” object for three students. Print the mark sheets.
